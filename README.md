Help Missing Kids!
On average, 1000 children go missing every day in the United States. According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), 1 in 6 missing children who run away become victims of human trafficking. HPCC Systems has partnered with NCMEC to help notify first responders, law enforcement, and the community when a child is reported missing. 
What can we do as developers to help understand this problem, and what can we do to help? This yearâ€™s challenge will analyze different social factors such as poverty, unemployment, and other areas to develop possible insights as to why so many are missing and to provide additional first responders and other resource information to the requestor.

The goal of the challenge is to answer two questions:
1. Is there a correlation between the locations that kids are reported missing and other social factors in that area
(unemployment, education, poverty, and population).
2. Can we provide additional information to the NCMEC feed to help find the missing children? (fire and police
stations, hospitals, churches, food banks, etc.)
